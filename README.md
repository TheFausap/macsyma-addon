# macsyma-addon

This repo contains some addons to the ITS Macsyma installation, ported from newer version available in modern Maxima.

QINF, QINFL and LOG2 are the QINF package written by John Lapeyre (https://github.com/jlapeyre/qinf.git) adapted to the old Macsyma and MACLISP

The directory structure is similar to ITS: SHARE and SHARE2 exist already, SHAREC is a new addition for the "contrib" packages.

Packages available:

- GAMALG : Gamma matrices algebra package
- QINF   : Quantum information package
- DIAG   : Diagonal matrices package
